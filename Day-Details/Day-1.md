While the submission date for challenge 11 is over, this provides good practice for building a website based on an existing design. Challenge 11 provides custom images and designs created by a UI designer. I started challenge 11 by reviewing both the desktop and mobile designs, planned accordingly, and then followed it with laying out the provided index.html file with HTML tags and classes. Since it is late in the evening, tomrrow will consist of adding CSS in order to replicate the design. Challenge 12 requires me to start Advent of Code and submit my solutions, my commits and solutions will start being committed tomorrow (I will have to solve 3 days worth of the event in order catch up).
