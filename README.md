# 100-Days-of-Code
This repository is meant to keep track of my activities while I participate in 100 Days of Code. 
In order to show my progress and record what I've done (aside from repositories I may create), I've decided to create a new repository that contains a more detailed account.

* Refactored/fixed errors in both projects

### Day 11:

### Days 20-25: 

* Been occupied with holiday season commitments
* Have been reading more about algorithms, more CSS properties
* Joined someone with completing the first FreeCodeCamp section
  * Going to look for a partner to learn Vue or Angular 2+ soon
* Have been taking extensive notes per section with partner 
* Still debugging facerecognition issue, unsure if it's a CORS issue
