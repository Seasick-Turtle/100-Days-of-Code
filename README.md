# 100 Days of Code

### Day 1:

* Forked coding challenge 13 from zeroDevs
* Trying to resolve issue that is preventing eslint from being used as a dev dependency & travis failing the repo from compiling
* Worked more on FCC tribute page project
* Joined new group on slack for additional future projects

### Day 2:

* Learned about animating SVGs from Frontend Masters
* Implemented 2 SVG animations in FCC tribute page
* Spent time learning how to use GIMP 2.10 and started making images for the tribute page
* Saw that issue I was working on for coding challenge 13 has been taken care of before I could submit a pull request, so I'll keep looking for other useful contributions I can make
