# 100-Days-of-Code
This repository is meant to keep track of my activities while I participate in 100 Days of Code. 
In order to show my progress and record what I've done (aside from repositories I may create), I've decided to create a new repository that contains a more detailed account. 

### Day 1: 
* Started Zero-to-Mastery challenges 11 & 12
* Reviewed Challenge 11 rules and designs, planned accordingly, added basic layout
* Challenge 11 & 12 commits/submissions will happen tomorrow due to late start


### Day 2:
* Was a bit preoccupied today, couldn't get much coding done today
* Managed to at least finish Advent of Code Day 1, part 1 
* Reviewed the frequency counter algorithm 
* Reinstalled global packages due to npm vulnerability 

### Day 3:
* Finished Day 1 of AoC
* Started on Day 2
* Spent time reviewing more algorithms
* Added images, grid and flexbox to Challenge 11

### Day 4:
* Didn't have much time today
* Managed to listen to JavaScript videos 
* Also completed Day 2 part 1, working on part 2
